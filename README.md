# FER2013_CF_vgg16_transferlearning

Here we performed FER using transfer learning on VGG16 by training on FER13[training: 28709, testing: 7178 and used the same weights to test on CKplus data[test: 981] and analysed the performance with above metrics.​

​

Looking at the test accuracy of 91% on a foreign data[CK+], it explains that VGG16 is a robust model which performed effectively on new data which suggests its use on other facial dataset too. ​
