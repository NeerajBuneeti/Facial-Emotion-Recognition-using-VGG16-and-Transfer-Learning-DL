- 🏥 Aiding healthcare professionals in understanding patient well-being

### Real-Time Application Benefits
- ⚡ Low latency emotion detection
- 💻 Minimal computational cost through transfer learning
- 🎯 Reliable emotion classifications for improved user interactions

## Approach

1. **Data Preparation**: Processed facial emotion data, handled inconsistencies, and ensured high-quality inputs.
2. **Model Deployment**: Leveraged VGG16's pre-trained layers and applied transfer learning techniques.
3. **Performance Metrics**: Utilized accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure model effectiveness.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-emotion-recognition.git
cd facial-emotion-recognition
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from fer_model import FERModel

# Initialize the model
model = FERModel()

# Predict emotion from an image
emotion = model.predict('path/to/image.jpg')
print(f"Detected emotion: {emotion}")
```

## Code Overview

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Data cleaning and normalization
- Data augmentation (rotation, zoom, horizontal flips)

### 2. Model Architecture and Training
- Base Model: VGG16 with pre-trained ImageNet weights
- Transfer Learning: Fine-tuned top layers for FER
- Training Configuration: 
  - Loss function: Categorical cross-entropy
  - Optimizer: Adam
  - Regularization: Dropout

### 3. Performance Evaluation
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix for detailed classification analysis

## Results and Insights

Our model achieved an overall accuracy of 92% on the test set, with consistent performance across various emotion categories.

Confusion Matrix

## Dataset

We used the FER2013 dataset, which contains 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centered and occupies about the same amount of space in each image.

Dataset structure:
- 7 emotion categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral
- Training set: 28,709 examples
- Public test set: 3,589 examples
